# Build a Microservices app with .Net and NextJS from scratch

This project aims to see how to build a microservices based app using .Net for the backend services and Next.js for the client app. Here are some of the things that are covered in this project:
- Creating several backend services using .Net that provide functionality for the app
- Service to service communication using RabbitMQ and gRPC
- Using IdentityServer as the identity provider.
- Creating a gateway using Microsoft YARP
- Building a client side app with Next.js using the new App Router functionality (since Next.js 13.4)
- Using SignalR for push notifications to the client app
- Dockerizing our different services
- CI/CD workflows using GitHub actions
- Adding ingress controllers
- Publishing the app locally using docker compose
- Unit and integration testing
- Publishing locally to Kubernetes
- Publishing the app to a Kubernetes cluster on the internet
